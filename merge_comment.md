The integration testing infrastructure is now in place, and all tests are passing both locally and in the CI/CD pipeline.

As discussed, I've created the following follow-up issues to address the suggestions from the PR review:

1. [Issue #163: Reduce Code Duplication in Integration Tests](https://github.com/PitchConnect/fogis-api-client-python/issues/163)
2. [Issue #164: Enhance Error Assertions and Test Isolation in Integration Tests](https://github.com/PitchConnect/fogis-api-client-python/issues/164)
3. [Issue #165: Update Main README with Integration Testing Information](https://github.com/PitchConnect/fogis-api-client-python/issues/165)
4. [Issue #166: Implement Parameterized Tests for Similar Test Cases](https://github.com/PitchConnect/fogis-api-client-python/issues/166)

These improvements will be implemented in follow-up PRs to keep the changes focused and manageable.
