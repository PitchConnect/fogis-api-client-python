Thank you for creating those follow-up issues! This is a great approach that aligns well with our contribution guidelines.

Given that:
1. The core implementation of the integration testing infrastructure is complete and working
2. The CI checks are passing
3. You've created well-defined follow-up issues for each of my suggestions
4. The PR already represents a significant improvement to the codebase

I recommend merging this PR as is and addressing the improvements in the follow-up PRs. This approach allows us to get the core functionality into the codebase sooner while still ensuring that the improvements will be made.

One question though - I noticed in my initial review that there was a comment about integration tests being disabled in CI. Is that still the case? If so, it would be valuable to enable them before merging, as having working integration tests in CI is a key part of the value this PR provides.

Otherwise, this looks good to merge! The follow-up issues you've created will help ensure that the integration testing infrastructure continues to improve over time.
