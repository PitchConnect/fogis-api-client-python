# PR Review: Implement comprehensive integration testing for API endpoints

Thank you for this comprehensive PR implementing integration testing for the API endpoints. I've reviewed the changes in detail and have the following feedback:

## Strengths

- **Well-structured integration tests**: The implementation provides excellent coverage of match result reporting scenarios including normal cases, error handling, and edge cases (extra time, penalties, walkovers).

- **Robust mock server architecture**: The mock server with request validation is well-designed and effectively ensures the client sends correctly structured requests to the API.

- **Thorough documentation**: The `integration_tests/README.md` provides clear explanations of the testing architecture, components, and usage instructions.

- **CI/CD integration**: The updates to the CI configuration and `run_ci_tests.sh` ensure tests run automatically in the pipeline.

- **Adherence to GitFlow**: The PR correctly targets the develop branch as specified in our contribution guidelines.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Reduce test setup/teardown duplication**: Almost every test method contains identical code for setting up and restoring base URLs. Consider extracting this into a pytest fixture or setup/teardown method:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_api_urls(mock_fogis_server):
    """Temporarily override API URLs to point to mock server."""
    original_base_url = FogisApiClient.BASE_URL
    original_internal_base_url = InternalApiClient.BASE_URL
    
    FogisApiClient.BASE_URL = f"{mock_fogis_server['base_url']}/mdk"
    InternalApiClient.BASE_URL = f"{mock_fogis_server['base_url']}/mdk"
    
    yield
    
    # Restore original URLs
    FogisApiClient.BASE_URL = original_base_url
    InternalApiClient.BASE_URL = original_internal_base_url
```

2. **Enhanced error assertions**: While the tests cover error cases, consider adding more specific assertions about error messages to ensure they're informative for developers.

3. **Test isolation**: The use of `clear-request-history` in some tests is good practice. Consider applying this consistently across all tests to ensure proper isolation.

## Future Considerations

I appreciate the "Future Work" section in the README that mentions expanding test coverage to additional endpoints (Issue #161) and improving documentation (Issue #162). These are valuable follow-ups.

Additionally, consider:

1. **Parameterized tests**: For similar test cases with different inputs (like various match result scenarios), pytest's parameterization could further reduce code duplication.

2. **Main README update**: Adding a brief section in the main README about integration tests would help highlight this important safeguard for new contributors.

## Conclusion

This PR significantly improves the project's testing infrastructure and addresses issue #139 effectively. The implementation is thorough and follows our contribution guidelines well.

I recommend merging after addressing the code duplication issue, as this would make future maintenance easier. Overall, excellent work!
