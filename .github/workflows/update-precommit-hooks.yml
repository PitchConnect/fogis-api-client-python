            # Update Pre-commit Hooks to Match CI/CD

            ## Description
            This PR automatically updates the pre-commit hooks configuration to match the current CI/CD pipeline settings.

            ## Changes
            - Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to align with CI/CD checks
            - Updated hook configurations to match CI/CD parameters (line length, ignore rules, etc.)
            - Generated or updated custom hooks as needed

            ## Related Issue
            Ensures local development environment matches CI/CD, preventing the issue where code passes locally but fails in CI.

            ## Type of Change
            - [x] Enhancement (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
            - [x] Maintenance (keeping configurations in sync)

            ## Testing
            - [x] Automatically generated and verified against CI/CD configuration

            ## Checklist
            - [x] The pre-commit hooks match the CI/CD pipeline
            - [x] All hooks use the same parameters as CI/CD
            - [x] Documentation is consistent with the changes
